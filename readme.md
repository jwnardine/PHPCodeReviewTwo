# _Jon's Word Counter Code Review_

#### By _**Jon Nardine**_

## Description

_This is Jon Nardine's second PHP code review, which will test his ability to use PHP, Twig, and Silex. The site will allow the user to use two forms, the first to input a word, and the second to input a sentence which may or may not contain said word a number of times. When the user clicks the button, they will be directed to a page which will tell them how many times said word appears in said sentence._

## Setup

Please visit this website:

http://jwnardine.github.io/PHPCodeReviewTwo

Clone the repository into the desktop using the command __git clone http://jwnardine.github.io/PHPCodeReviewTwo__

Open the project folder in the command prompt, and use the prompt __composer install__. This will set up the correct dependencies for your computer.

Once composer has installed, access the /web directory (prompt __cd web__ from project folder), and then type __php -S localhost:8000__ and hit enter.

From this point, type __localhost:8000__ into the url bar of your preferred internet browser, and the project homepage should show up in the browser.

If the project home page DOES NOT show up in the browser, you may have to delete the /vendor folder from the project folder, and run __composer install__ again.

## Technologies Used

_PHP, PHPUnit Twig, Silex, Markdown, Github_
